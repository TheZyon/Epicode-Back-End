# Epicode-Back-End

Programs made during the back-end part of the full-stack Epicode course. 
This repo will be almost daily updated with exercises during the course. 
The topics will be: 

1. Basic Java
2. JPA
3. Spring Boot Apps

Once per week a little project will be pushed, 
and once per month a larger group project labeled "buildweek" will be pushed.

Enjoy!
